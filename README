Q1: Assignment 1 

We Used strace to understand what a program -"WhatIDo arg" is doing. 
The steps of the program are:

- Opens the directory named "Welcome".
- Opens the directory "To" in the previous directory "Welcome" - (Welcome\To).
- Inside the "To" directory, opens a new file named "OS2021" - (Welcome\To\OS2021).
- Use the "fstat" function to handle the file where we want to write.
- Writes in the file "username
	  	      If you haven't read the course guidline yet --- do it right now! 
	              arg".
- Close the file.
- Deletes the file.
- Deletes the folder "TO".
- Deletes the folder "Welcome".
- Close the program and all the threads in the process.
